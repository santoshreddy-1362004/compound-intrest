          <Typography paragraph>
            Compound is a decentralized finance protocol that allows users to supply and borrow assets without intermediaries. It uses an algorithmic system to adjust interest rates based on supply and demand .
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Users earn interest by supplying assets like DAI, USDC, or ETH, and can borrow other assets by posting collateral.

          <Typography paragraph>
            Our Compound Interest Calculator helps users estimate how much they will earn by supplying assets to Compound or how much they will pay if they borrow.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            You simply enter:
            <ul>
              <li>The token (DAI, USDC, ETH)</li>
              <li>Amount you plan to supply/borrow</li>
              <li>Time period (in days)</li>
            </ul>
            The tool then calculates daily, weekly, and monthly returns using real-time Compound rates.
